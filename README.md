AshleyCPP
=========

AshleyCPP is an (unimaginatively named) C++ port of the Java entity framework [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/).

It prioritises speed and ease of use, and mirrors the public API of the original where possible.

The original is inspired by the [Ash](http://www.ashframework.org/) and
[Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/) frameworks.

### License

AshleyCPP has the same license as the original, as shown here:

> Ashley is licensed under the [Apache 2 License](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/blob/master/LICENSE), meaning you
> can use it free of charge, without strings attached in commercial and non-commercial projects. We love to
> get (non-mandatory) credit in case you release a game or app using Ashley!
